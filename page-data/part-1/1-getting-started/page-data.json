Defining DevOps is not a trivial task but the term itself consists of two parts, <em>Dev</em> and <em>Ops</em>. <em>Dev</em> refers to the development of software and <em>Ops</em> to operations. Simple definition for DevOps would be that it means the release, configuring, and monitoring of software is in the hands of the very people who develop it.</p><p>A more formal definition is offered by <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2962707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jabbari et al.</a>: \"DevOps is a development methodology aimed at bridging the gap between Development and Operations, emphasizing communication and collaboration, continuous integration, quality assurance and delivery with automated deployment utilizing a set of development practices\".</p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Devops-toolchain.svg\"><p>Image of DevOps toolchain by Kharnagy from <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Devops-toolchain.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wikipedia</a></p><p><em>Sometimes</em> DevOps is regarded as a role that one person or a team can fill.

Then your team of 1-n developers create the software. It works on your computer. It may even go through a testing pipeline working perfectly. You send it to the server and...</p><p>...it does not work.</p><p>This is known as the <strong>\"works on my machine\"</strong> problem. The only way to solve this is by finding out what in tarnation the developer had installed on their machine that made the application work.</p><p>Containers solve this problem by allowing the developer to personally run the application inside a container, which then includes all of the dependencies required for the app to work.</p><ul>\n<li>You may still occasionally hear about \"works in my <strong>container</strong>\" issues - these are often just usage errors.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"scenario-2-isolated-environments\" style=\"position:relative;\">Scenario 2: Isolated environments<a href=\"#scenario-2-isolated-environments\" aria-label=\"scenario 2 isolated environments permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3><p>You have 5 different Python applications. You need to deploy them to a server that already has an application requiring Python 2.7 and of course none of your applications are 2.7. What do you do?</p><p>Since containers package the software with all of its dependencies, you package the existing app and all 5 new ones with their respective python versions and that's it.</p><p>I can only imagine the disaster that would result if you try to run them side by side on the same machine without isolating the environments. It sounds more like a time bomb. Sometimes different parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not working.

When you run a command, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">docker container run</code>, behind the scenes the client sends a request through the REST API to the <strong>docker daemon</strong> which takes care of images, containers and other resources.</p><p>You can read the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs for more information</a>. But even though you will find over 50 commands in the documentation, only a handful of them is needed for general use. There's a list of the most commonly used basic commands at the end of this section.</p><p>One of them is already familiar: <code class=\"language-text\">docker container run &lt;image&gt;</code>, which instructs daemon to create a container from the image and downloading the image if it is not available.</p><p>Let's remove the image since we will not need it anymore, <code class=\"language-text\">docker image rm hello-world</code> sounds about right. However, this should fail with the following error:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker image rm hello-world\n  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference &quot;hello-world&quot; (must force) - container &lt;container ID&gt; is using its referenced image &lt;image ID&gt;</code></pre></div><p>This means that a container that was created from the image <em>hello-world</em> still exists and that removing <em>hello-world</em> could have consequences. So before removing images, you should have the referencing container removed first. Forcing is usually a bad idea, especially as we are still learning.</p><p>Run <code class=\"language-text\">docker container ls -a</code> to list all containers again.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker container ls -a\n  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND        CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES\n  b7a53260b513   hello-world     &quot;/hello&quot;       35 minutes ago   Exited (0) 35 minutes ago             brave_bhabha\n  1cd4cb01482d   hello-world     &quot;/hello&quot;       41 minutes ago   Exited (0) 41 minutes ago             vibrant_bell</code></pre></div><p>Notice that containers have a <em>CONTAINER ID</em> and <em>NAME</em>. The names are currently autogenerated. When we have a lot of different containers, we can use grep (or another similar utility) to filter the list:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker container ls -a | grep hello-world</code></pre></div><p>Let's remove the container with <code class=\"language-text\">docker container rm</code> command. It accepts a container's name or ID as its arguments.</p><p>Notice that the command also works with the first few characters of an ID. For example, if a container's ID is 3d4bab29dd67, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">docker container rm 3d</code> to delete it. Using the shorthand for the ID will not delete multiple containers, so if you have two IDs starting with 3d, a warning will be printed, and neither will be deleted. You can also use multiple arguments: <code class=\"language-text\">docker container rm id1 id2 id3</code></p><p>If you have hundreds of stopped containers and you wish to delete them all, you should use <code class=\"language-text\">docker container prune</code>. Prune can also be used to remove \"dangling\" images with <code class=\"language-text\">docker image prune</code>. Dangling images are images that do not have a name and are not used. They can be created manually and are automatically generated during build. Removing them just saves some space.</p><p>And finally you can use <code class=\"language-text\">docker system prune</code> to clear almost everything. We aren't yet familiar with the exceptions that <code class=\"language-text\">docker system prune</code> does not remove.</p><p>After removing all of the <em>hello-world</em> containers, run <code class=\"language-text\">docker image rm hello-world</code> to delete the image. You can use <code class=\"language-text\">docker image ls</code> to confirm that the image is not listed.</p><p>You can also use the <code class=\"language-text\">image pull</code> command to download images without running them: <code class=\"language-text\">docker image pull hello-world</code></p><p>Let's try starting a new container:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker container run nginx</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the command line appears to freeze after pulling and starting the container. This is because Nginx is now running in the current terminal, blocking the input. You can observe this with <code class=\"language-text\">docker container ls</code> from another terminal. Let's exit by pressing <code class=\"language-text\">control + c</code> and try again with the <code class=\"language-text\">-d</code> flag.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ docker container run -d nginx\n  c7749cf989f61353c1d433466d9ed6c45458291106e8131391af972c287fb0e5</code></pre></div><p>The <code class=\"language-text\">-d</code> flag starts a container <em>detached</em>, meaning that it runs in the background.
